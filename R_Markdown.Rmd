##Data processing
Seperate out teosinte (ZMPBA, ZMPIL, and ZMPJA) and maize (ZMMIL OR ZMMLR OR ZMMMR )

Put header of the genotype file into its own file for use later


Add headers to both teosinte and maize genotype files



Transpose both genotype files to swap the rows and columns

```t()
```

Sort genotpye and snp file based off column 1, "SNP_ID"


Sort genotpye and snp file based off column 1, "SNP_ID"


Join files together to combine the SNP ID and the genotype


###Teosinte Awk out all the 40 files Then use setd to change "?" to "-"



###Maize Awk out all the 40 files Then use setd to change "?" to "-"


###Maize Unknown SNPs


Multiple Position SNPs


###Teosinte Unknown SNPs


Multiple Position SNPs
